# Genetic-Algorithms-Two-Towers

This project solves the Two Towers problem using Genetic Algorithm. Given n, we seek a combination of blocks so that two towers are the same height. However, the blocks only consist of block with area 1, 2 ... n. This means that the height of the block are sqrt(val) and each value is only used once. For instance, given the value 10, the best towers are blocks 1 4 5 8 10 and 2 3 6 7 9. Here the difference between the towers is .007. This problem was brought up in my Data Structures class where we used an iterator to go through every possible subset and return the value closest to the target (where target is the half of the sum of the sqrt(k) where k is every block). Instead of using an iterator this class uses a Genetic Algorithm to calculate the best (shorter) tower.
